# Java skeleton

A minimal project for getting started with Maven. It includes JUnit and a test that verifies that you can build and run unit tests.

Build:

    mvn clean install
    

It builds with a warning. There is no production code so Maven will warn you that the resulting jar will be empty.


    [WARNING] JAR will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!

Include some production code and this warning will disappear.
